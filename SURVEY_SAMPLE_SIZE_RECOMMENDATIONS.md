## Recommended Sample Sizes

### Minimum Realistic Sample Size

| Survey Type | Minimum Respondents | Target Respondents | Ideal Respondents |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Problem Survey** | 30 | 50-75 | 100+ |
| **Solution Survey** | 30 | 50-75 | 100+ |
| **Combined Analysis** | 50 | 75-100 | 150+ |

**Recommendation for Short Time Period (1-2 weeks)**: **30-50 respondents per survey**

**Recommendation for Medium Time Period (3-4 weeks)**: **50-75 respondents per survey**

---

## Sample Size Justification

### Statistical Considerations

#### For Descriptive Research (Capstone Project)
- **Minimum**: 30 respondents (statistical rule of thumb for normal distribution)
- **Recommended**: 50-75 respondents (better representation and reliability)
- **Ideal**: 100+ respondents (higher confidence, but may not be feasible)

#### Confidence Level and Margin of Error
Assuming 95% confidence level:

| Sample Size | Margin of Error | Confidence Level |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| 30 | ±17.9% | 95% |
| 50 | ±13.9% | 95% |
| 75 | ±11.3% | 95% |
| 100 | ±9.8% | 95% |

**For Capstone Projects**: A margin of error of ±10-15% is acceptable and realistic.

## Realistic Expectations by Time Period

### Short Time Period (1-2 weeks)

**Target**: 30-50 respondents per survey

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Online survey (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, etc.)
- Social media (Facebook groups, property management groups)
- Direct email to property managers
- University/college networks
- Local property management associations

**Expected Response Rate**: 10-20% (if 200-300 invitations sent)

**Realistic Outcome**:
- **Problem Survey**: 30-40 respondents
- **Solution Survey**: 30-40 respondents
- **Total**: 60-80 respondents

**Justification**: 
- Sufficient for descriptive analysis
- Allows for basic statistical analysis
- Realistic for short time frame
- Demonstrates research effort

---

### Medium Time Period (3-4 weeks)

**Target**: 50-75 respondents per survey

**Distribution Strategy**:
- All methods from short period, plus:
- In-person distribution at property management offices
- Property management conferences/events
- Real estate agent networks
- Follow-up reminders

**Expected Response Rate**: 15-25% (if 300-400 invitations sent)

**Realistic Outcome**:
- **Problem Survey**: 50-60 respondents
- **Solution Survey**: 50-60 respondents
- **Total**: 100-120 respondents

**Justification**:
- Good statistical representation
- Allows for subgroup analysis
- More credible for capstone project
- Better for publication/presentation

---

## Sample Size by Demographic Segments

### Minimum Respondents per Segment

| Segment | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Property Owners/Landlords | 10 | 20-30 |
| Property Managers | 10 | 20-30 |
| Tenants | 5 | 10-15 |
| Real Estate Agents | 5 | 10-15 |

**Note**: If total sample is 30-50, ensure at least 20-30 are from primary target (Property Managers/Owners).

---

## Response Rate Expectations

### Realistic Response Rates by Distribution Method

| Distribution Method | Expected Response Rate | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Online Survey (Email)** | 10-20% | Most common method |
| **Social Media** | 5-15% | Lower engagement |
| **In-Person** | 30-50% | Higher but time-consuming |
| **Direct Contact** | 20-40% | Personal approach works better |
| **Combined Methods** | 15-25% | Best overall approach |

### Calculation Example

**For 50 respondents target with 20% response rate**:
- Need to distribute: 50 ÷ 0.20 = **250 invitations**
- Plan for: 300 invitations (accounting for non-responses)

---

## Practical Recommendations for Short Time Period

### Week 1: Distribution and Initial Responses

**Day 1-2**: Survey preparation and testing
- Finalize survey questions
- Test survey links
- Prepare distribution materials

**Day 3-7**: Initial distribution
- Send to personal networks (50-100 contacts)
- Post on social media groups (5-10 groups)
- Email to property management contacts (50-100 emails)
- **Target**: 20-30 initial responses

### Week 2: Follow-up and Additional Distribution

**Day 8-10**: First follow-up
- Reminder emails to non-respondents
- Additional social media posts
- **Target**: Additional 10-20 responses

**Day 11-14**: Final push
- Second follow-up
- In-person distribution (if possible)
- **Target**: Final 10-20 responses

**Total Expected**: 40-70 responses (realistic for 2 weeks)

When documenting your sample size, include:

1. **Target Sample Size**: 50-75 respondents per survey
2. **Actual Sample Size**: [Fill in after data collection]
3. **Response Rate**: [Calculate: Responses / Invitations × 100]
4. **Justification**: 
   - Statistical: Minimum 30 for normal distribution
   - Practical: Realistic for time constraints
   - Academic: Meets capstone project requirements
5. **Limitations**: 
   - Sample size limitations
   - Time constraints
   - Geographic limitations (if applicable)

## Tips for Achieving Target Sample Size

### 1. Multiple Distribution Channels
- Don't rely on a single method
- Use 3-4 different channels simultaneously

### 2. Personal Networks
- Start with friends, family, colleagues
- Ask them to share with their networks

### 3. Incentives (if allowed)
- Small incentives can increase response rate
- Check with advisor/university policies

### 4. Clear Communication
- Explain the purpose clearly
- Mention it's for academic research
- Keep survey short (10-15 minutes)

### 5. Follow-up Strategy
- Send 2-3 reminders (not too many)
- Space reminders 3-5 days apart

### 6. Timing
- Avoid holidays
- Send on weekdays (Tuesday-Thursday best)
- Morning emails get better response

### 7. Social Media Strategy
- Join relevant Facebook groups
- Post in property management forums
- Use relevant hashtags

## Sample Size Calculator Reference

### Formula for Margin of Error

```
Margin of Error = Z × √(p(1-p)/n)

Where:
Z = Z-score (1.96 for 95% confidence)
p = Proportion (0.5 for maximum variability)
n = Sample size
```

### Quick Reference Table

| Sample Size | Margin of Error (±%) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 30 | 17.9% |
| 40 | 15.5% |
| 50 | 13.9% |
| 60 | 12.7% |
| 70 | 11.7% |
| 80 | 11.0% |
| 90 | 10.3% |
| 100 | 9.8% |

---

**Conclusion**: For a short time period (1-2 weeks), **targeting 40-50 respondents per survey** is realistic, achievable, and academically acceptable for a capstone project. This provides sufficient data for meaningful analysis while being honest about time constraints.
